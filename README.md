VYVGART IV infusion dosage calculator

This is a simple vibe-coded app (PWA) that takes a patient's mass in kg and calculates:
- VYVGART dosage in mg
- VYVGART dosage in mL
- Number of full vials to use
- mL from the last vial
- remaining mL in the last vial (waste)
- mL to remove from a 100 mL IV normal saline bag in order to end up with 125 mL after adding the VYVGART dose.
