# VYVGART IV infusion dosage calculator
This is a simple vibe-coded app (PWA) that takes a patient's mass in kg and calculates:
- VYVGART dosage in mg
- VYVGART dosage in mL
- Number of vials to use
- mL from the last vial
- remaining mg in the last vial (waste)
- mL to remove from a 100 mL IV normal saline bag in order to end up with 125 mL after adding the VYVGART dose

## Access / Installation
You can access the calculator here:

- Press add to home screen (or your browser's equivalent)
- Follow your browser's instructions to add it as an app (rather than a shortcut)
